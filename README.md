Project Details : 
On February 6, 2023, a very disastrous earthquake occurred in Turkey. About 11 cities were severely affected by this earthquake. Almost all buildings in the cities were destroyed and tens of thousands of lives were lost. The wounds caused by the earthquake began to heal slowly. Affected provinces; Kahramanmaraş, Hatay, Adıyaman, Osmaniye, Gaziantep, Şanlıurfa, Malatya, Diyarbakır, Adana, Kilis and Elazığ.
A very important presidential election was going to take place in Turkey's 100th anniversary and it was necessary to ensure that everyone who wanted to vote did so. I formed a group with my friends Okan Demirbilek and Şeref Yiğit Yuksel and tried to find a solution to this. And as a result of this solution, we developed this website.
We thought that ballot boxes should be set up in certain places according to the population density and people should be able to go there and vote by showing their identity cards. We have designed such a website so that people can easily access these established ballot boxes. When you enter the site, select the city you are in and then click the "show chests" button, you can see the location data of all the chests in your city. We used react and leaflet while doing this project.
